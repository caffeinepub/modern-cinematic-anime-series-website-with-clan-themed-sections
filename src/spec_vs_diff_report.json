  "summary": "Diff implements major parts of the Clan Personality Quiz (scoring, questions, results card, copy-to-clipboard sharing), adds a Power System Database section (tabs + searchable character abilities), integrates Quiz/Powers navigation, and introduces a Secret Vault view with localStorage-based progress and lore fragments. However, evidence for unlockable character info/artwork gating and inclusion of the required generated image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated is missing from the diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Add hidden unlockable lore and artwork including hidden character info and bonus artwork gated behind discovery/unlock, plus several discoverable lore fragments with found vs missing UI.",
      "reason": "Lore fragments and a vault UI are present, and at least one discovery mechanic marks fragments found, but the diff provides no evidence that hidden character info and bonus artwork are actually unlockable/gated via discovery (only fragment unlocking is shown). The vault component is truncated, so gating/lock logic for characters/artwork and found-vs-missing indicators cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "The code references four generated artwork paths under /assets/generated, but the diff summary does not show any new image files added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Without those assets being added, the requirement to include the generated images and have them load in production cannot be verified.",
