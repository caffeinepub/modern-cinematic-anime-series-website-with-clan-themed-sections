  "summary": "The diff does not implement the requested homepage section reordering. The only change is to `project_state.json`, which does not provide evidence of any frontend layout/DOM section order updates or preserved scroll target ids.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-50",
      "requirement": "Reposition the existing homepage content sections so they appear in this exact vertical order on the main page: Hero, Story/About, Characters, Clans, Episodes, Gallery, News/Updates; and ensure Header navigation scroll targets still land on the correct section DOM ids (#hero, #about, #characters, #clans, #episodes, #gallery, #news), with no sections added/removed.",
      "reason": "No frontend source files were modified to reorder sections or verify/maintain the required section DOM ids and HeaderNav scroll behavior; only a project metadata file was changed.",

        "project_state.json"

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks for reordering existing homepage sections and preserving scroll targets/ids; changing `project_state.json` content is not requested and does not implement the UI reorder.",
