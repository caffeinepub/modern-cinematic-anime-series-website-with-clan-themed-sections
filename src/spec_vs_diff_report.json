      "reason": "The new DonationSection includes custom phrasing and additional emoji/text (e.g., \"Help bring the story...\", \"Thank you for your support! 💙\", \"🔥\", \"🌙\") rather than any clearly user-supplied verbatim block. The BuildRequest requires using the exact text provided by the user, but the implemented copy appears authored in the diff.",
