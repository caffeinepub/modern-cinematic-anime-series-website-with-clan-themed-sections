  "summary": "Diff adds new Collaboration/Supporter Help forms, new admin panels and dashboard tabs, and adds new backend state/types and React Query hooks. However, several required fields and backend type/API details do not match the BuildRequest, and multiple unrelated UI/feature changes were introduced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Collaboration form must collect Name, Email, Optional Social Media Links, and Message (no other required/unrequested fields).",
      "reason": "The added CollaborationForm component shows state for a `company` field rather than an optional social media links field; the diff does not provide evidence of a social links input being implemented.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/sections/CollaborationForm.tsx"

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Supporter Help form must collect Name, Email, Optional Social Media Links, and Message, and the destructive warning remains visible above the form.",
      "reason": "The added SupporterHelpForm component includes `company` plus submits `subject`, `product`, and `serial` fields; the diff provides no evidence of an Optional Social Media Links input, and the required destructive warning text is not shown in the truncated SupporterHelpForm snippet.",

      "requirement": "Backend type for Collaboration submissions must store: id, senderName, senderEmail, socialLinks, message, and submittedAt timestamp; and expose public submit + admin-only query list API (Unauthorized trap for non-admins).",
      "reason": "The backend type shown is `CollaborationRequest` with fields `name`, `company`, `email`, `message`, and `timestamp`, which does not match the required field names/shape (missing senderName/senderEmail/socialLinks/submittedAt). The diff snippet also does not show the required public submit method or the admin-only query method and its Unauthorized trapping.",

      "reason": "The backend type shown is `SupportRequest` with extra fields (`company`, `subject`, `product`, `serial`) and uses `name`/`email`/`timestamp` instead of the required senderName/senderEmail/socialLinks/submittedAt fields. The diff snippet also does not show the required public submit method or the admin-only query method and its Unauthorized trapping.",
