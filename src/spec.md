# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Introduce a reusable glassmorphism “glowing glass card panel” style and apply it consistently to key text-focused panels across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a reusable styling API (shared class and/or wrapper component) for a semi-transparent, backdrop-blurred glass panel with rounded corners, subtle shadow, and a soft glowing border that works in both light and dark themes.
- Apply the new glowing glass panel style to existing text panels/cards (at minimum: About section feature cards, News post cards, and the News “Create New Post” form) while keeping layout, animations, and copy unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Text-focused cards and forms across the site (including About and News) share a consistent glassy, softly glowing card appearance without changing app behavior.
