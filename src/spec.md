# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Reorder the existing homepage sections to match the required vertical sequence while keeping all current section ids and header navigation scroll targets working.

**Planned changes:**
- Reposition the existing homepage sections so the top-to-bottom order is: Hero, Story/About, Characters, Clans, Episodes, Gallery, News / Updates.
- Verify and preserve the existing section DOM ids and Header navigation scroll targets: #hero, #about, #characters, #clans, #episodes, #gallery, #news.

**User-visible outcome:** On the main (non-admin) homepage, sections appear in the specified order and the Header navigation links still scroll to the correct sections.
