  "summary": "Build a modern anime streaming/promo-style website for \"Whispers Of The White Moon\" with dark cinematic styling, glowing accents, smooth transitions/parallax, content sections (Characters, Episodes, Gallery, News/Updates, Clans), and a secure admin dashboard for the site owner to manage all anime content.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Visual direction: anime streaming/promo-site feel with dark theme (navy/black/deep purple) and glowing accents (moon blue, fiery gold).",
    "Animation direction: smooth fade transitions; implement parallax scrolling where performant and appropriate (with reduced-motion support).",
    "Update/extend site information architecture to include top-level sections for Characters, Episodes, Gallery, and News/Updates (in addition to Home/Story/Clans) accessible via the top navigation.",
    "Add a secure admin/auth layer and an owner-only admin dashboard for managing site content (episodes, characters, news posts, gallery images, clans), styled consistently with the main dark theme.",
    "Admin dashboard should support role-based access control (RBAC) with permissions by role, including team member account administration.",
    "Homepage should include a dedicated \"Series Overview\" subsection within the About/Story area, featuring the provided narrative overview text.",
    "Public Episodes UI should conditionally render an embedded video player for episodes marked Released; otherwise show a clear \"not released yet\" message/state.",
    "Homepage layout: ensure existing sections (Story, Characters, Clans, Episodes, Gallery, News/Updates) can be reordered to match the intended page flow while keeping stable section DOM ids for nav scrolling.",
    "Homepage UX: add clear, prominent section title headings for each main section (Hero/Series title, Story, Characters, Clans, Episodes, Gallery, News) so users see the section name as they scroll.",
    "Hero enhancements: add subtle floating particle layer + parallax background + animated glowing logo on load + fade-in text transitions; include reduced-motion support and keep effects performant. Ambient music must be opt-in with an obvious toggle (muted/off by default) and must not auto-play without user interaction."

  "known_issues": [
    "User reports the Gallery “+” upload button is not visible (likely due to not being authenticated as an admin).",
    "Build/deployment failed due to a configuration error (Caffeine platform error).",
    "Build/generation process intermittently fails with \"couldn't generate your application\" / \"AI couldn't handle that request\" errors.",
    "Pro mode: admin cannot edit presentation text after clicking the \"Pro\" tab (editing UI/flow not working or missing).",
    "Public Gallery is showing the wrong image (fallback/seeded image) instead of the user-uploaded image; user requested it be removed."
