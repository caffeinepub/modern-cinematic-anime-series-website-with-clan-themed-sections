  "summary": "The diff shows only 3 modified files (backend/main.mo, frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json) with no file deletions. All 5 requirements specify file deletions or removal of specific code elements, but the diff provides insufficient evidence of these removals. The frontend-file-summaries.txt indicates significant frontend structure exists but does not confirm deletion of SignupModal, signupStorage.ts, or passwordHash.ts files. The backend/main.mo truncated content shows no UserProfile type or authentication methods, but without seeing deleted lines or complete file content, it's unclear if these were removed as requested or never existed. No evidence of backend/migration.mo changes is provided.",
